Welcome to my collection of machine learning algorithm implementations for **practice**, **reference**, and **portfolio** purposes.

This repository is designed to deepen understanding of core ML concepts by implementing algorithms from scratch and/or using well-known libraries. Each implementation is accompanied by clear code, comments, and, when applicable, illustrative notebooks or examples.

## 📌 Goals

* ✅ Strengthen understanding of ML fundamentals through hands-on coding.
* ✅ Serve as a learning reference for others.
* ✅ Showcase clean, organized, and modular implementations for portfolio use.

---

## 🧰 Technologies

* Python 3.10+
* Jupyter Notebook (for examples and visualization)
* NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn (when applicable)
* Matplotlib / seaborn (for visualizations)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheusjtavares/ml_methods.git
cd ml_methods
```

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Explore the code or run the jupyter files in `ml_methods/*`.
